wala ko idea ngano dali lng to mag change imo mood ganiha. please let me understand.
we were doing very good earlier man bai ni ingon naka na na anad najd ka nako sa apartment. 
nganong with a snap of a finger naguba nadayun. 
I am very new to this. sauna imo explanation kay wala lng mo kalit lng kag kasuko. 
but ang situation ta ganiha is different.

In an essence I dont know why you hate me so much. 
Wala man tika na away. wala man tika na sakit. 
I am doing my best man to be a good boyfriend and to be better.
I have patience man nimo on your communication.
sa mga times na indecisive ka I support man.


confused kos nahitabo ganiha. ok ra man ta exchanging good words. I still feel the moment.
then nag change na dayun imo mood. I feel like it was because na wala ko ni lihok dayun. 


I’m a bit confused about what happened earlier. We were doing well and having a good time, then it felt like your mood suddenly changed. 
I want to understand so I can be better for you. I’m still new to situations like this, so I might not always know how to respond. 
But I want you to know I’ve been trying my best to be a good boyfriend, to be patient, and to support you—even when things are uncertain. 
Can we talk about it?
